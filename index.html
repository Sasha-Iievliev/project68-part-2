      <p class="text-muted">As the Acting Principal, I am very proud of our school and believe it to be a fabulous
        educational facility that truly offers our students the complete package. Orchard Grove
        Primary School is recognised by the Education Department as a high performing
        school. There is no doubt that we have outstanding academic results, but we believe
        what makes us such a great school is how we educate and care for the whole child;
        offering our community excellence in education coupled with a strong wellbeing
        approach that makes each child feel they belong.
        Our school community is highly motivated and involved in the daily activities at the
        school and our parents have a strong desire to partner together with our teachers to
        provide the best opportunities for the children. We love our school and see ourselves
        as a caring community that values academic success, but also treasures the nurturing
        and development of the whole child.
        Please spend the time reading through this pack as it will help you to get a picture of
        what our school is all about and how things operate here.
        If you would like to discuss any aspect of what Orchard Grove Primary School has on
        offer for your child, or if you have any particular needs or queries, please don't hesitate
        to contact the office and make an appointment with myself or our wonderful Assistant
        Principals, Charlee McElligott or Andrew Moore.</p>

    concepts concerned with the outcomes of acts. They continue to develop their understanding of the complexity of

        <hr>
        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">The schools principal office was built in 1991</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">The School Council is a legal body consisting of twelve elected representatives, plus the Principal. These
          representatives comprise four Department of Education and Training (DET) and eight non-Department of
          Education and Training employees, plus one co-opted non-Department of Education and Training employees.
          The School Council is responsible for the management of the school, including finances, buildings, grounds
          and equipment. Much of its work is organised through School Council sub-committees. The School Council
          reports to parents through a formal written annual report, as well as regular articles in the newsletter. School
          Council elections are held each year, usually in March. Remember the parents elected to the School Council
          are your representatives.
          The President of the current School Council is Mr Trevor Hookey.</p>
